module:	variance
----------------

Description:
  Variance filter.  Calculates the variance on the last 4 X and Y axis values
  independently, and averages the two samples with the smallest variance.

Parameters:
  xlimit
	Sets the X axis variance limit on the last 4 touch screen samples,
	in touch screen coordinates.  Variances outside this limit will
	cause 4 extra samples to be collected.

  ylimit
	Sets the Y axis variance limit on the last 4 touch screen samples,
	in touch screen coordinates.  Variances outside this limit will
	cause 4 extra samples to be collected.

  pthreshold
	Sets the pressure threshold, above which we believe the pen
	to be down.

module: dejitter
----------------

Description:
  Removes jitter on the X and Y co-ordinates.  Samples whos X and Y
  differentials are within these limits will be treated as an identical
  value, and gobbled up.

Parameters:
  xdelta
  ydelta
	Sets the minimum differential between the current and the previous
	X or Y sample.

  pthreshold

module: linear
--------------

Description:
  Linear scaling module, primerily used for conversion of touch screen
  co-ordinates to screen co-ordinates.

Parameters:
  none
